Overload - reuse same method name

Overloading happens inside single class, but can apply to subclass.

METHODS ARE OVERLOADED IF FOLLOWING
    1. Methods have same name
    2. Methods have different variables / parameters

If methods follow those rules they may have different return types, access modifiers or throw different
checked or unchecked exceptions

OVERRIDING

Method in child class that already exist in parent

By extending the parent class the child class gets all the methods (public) in the parent class,
thus Overriding means we override the method already defined in the parent class

CONSIDERED OVERRIDING IF FOLLOWING:
    1. Must have same name and arguments
    2. Return type can be subclass of return type in parent class
    3. Cant have lower access modifier
    If parent method is protected then using private in child is not allowed but using public
    would be allowed

Only inheritent methods can be overridden
