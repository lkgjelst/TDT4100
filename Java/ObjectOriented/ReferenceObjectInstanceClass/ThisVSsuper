Super is used ti call parents class members (variables and methods)

This is used to call the current class methods and variables.

This. used with constructors and setters. Ude this keyword in constructor and setter.

Super. commonly used with method overriding (@Override).

this() vs super()

this() - is used to call a constructor withing another constructor. As we have previously done with overloaded
constructors in the same class.

The call to THIS() can only be used in a constructor, AND MUST be the first statement in the constructor. It's used
with constructor chaining, in other words when one constructor calls another constructor and helps to reduce
duplicated code.

Only way to call a parent constructor is through SUPER().

call to SUPER() must be first statement in each constructor.

CONSTRUCTOR CAN HAVE THIS() OR SUPER() BUT NEVER BOTH.
