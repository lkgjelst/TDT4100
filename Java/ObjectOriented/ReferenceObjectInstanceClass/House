The analogy of building a house to classes.

A class is basically a blueprint for building a house. We can build as many houses (objects) as we want with the
blueprints.

Each house you build (in other words instantiate using 'new' operator) is an OBJECT also known as an INSTANCE

Each house you build has its own address (location). Give someone address - this is known as a reference.

Reference can be copied many times - but same house.



House blueHouse = new House("blue");

object of type House created, with color blue.

House anotherHouse = blueHouse;

This is pointing to the same house, however two different references to the same house.

No way to access an object directly - all is done through the reference to the object.
